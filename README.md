# WebsocketChat
A simple chat client and server that uses websocket and node.js to send messages.

Contains a web server built in Node.js that listens for clients, and a chat client web page that connects to it.  The server will broadcast any messages that it receives to all connected clients.  

Future plans for this project include user-to-user chats, creation of groups, and creation of multiple chat rooms.  Additionally, messages will be stored in a database (considering SQLite for this).
